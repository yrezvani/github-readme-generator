# Github Readme Generator

This app simplifies the process of adding a README.md file to your project. The app is terminal-based with not GUI. The user answers a series of prompts about their project, and a README.md file is generated based on those questions. The readme file adds a badge for the license and has a table of contents that takes the user to the right section upon clicking.
